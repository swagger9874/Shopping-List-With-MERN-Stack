# What I learned? 
I learned how to write a MERN Stack application. And also what Express and MongoDB are. I learned how to use them and how they work.

You will need Node.js and MongoDB installed on your computer. Once you install them open ...MongoDB/Server/"Version"/bin on a command
prompt and write "mongod" to start server.
